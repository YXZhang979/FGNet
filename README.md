This paper, published at IJCAI 2023, addresses the challenges of bridging both inter-class and intra-class gaps in few-shot segmentation. Our code is largely based on the SSP project (https://github.com/fanq15/SSP), and we extend our gratitude for their valuable contribution to the community. While most of our code has been released, the remaining components, including the 3D Point Cloud FSS version, will be available soon.
