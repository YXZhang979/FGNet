This paper is published on IJCAI'23, which aims to fill the inter-class and intra-class gaps for few-shot segmentation. Our code is highly based on SSP: https://github.com/fanq15/SSP. Thanks for their contribution to the community. Currently, most of the code has been released, and others together with the 3D Point Cloud FSS version will come soon.
